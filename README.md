Empire State Building Game Analysis

In the simulation of the Empire State Building game, Python was utilized to simulate a player's movements through random walks of 100 steps each, incorporating randomness and potential clumsiness. The analysis involved generating various random walks, tracking the steps taken, and determining the likelihood of reaching specific step counts.

The exploration began with simulating 500 random walks of 100 steps each, considering occasional clumsiness (falling back to the starting point) and calculating the distribution of endpoint positions. This process facilitated the estimation of the probability of reaching at least 60 steps high by evaluating the proportion of endpoint positions greater than or equal to 60, yielding an approximate chance.

Next, hacker statistics were employed to simulate 500 rounds of the game, calculating the frequency of achieving 60 steps or higher in each round. This computational approach was executed to provide a more granular understanding of the probability.

The final analysis revealed an estimated chance of 77.2% reaching at least 60 steps high using the initial random walk simulations.
